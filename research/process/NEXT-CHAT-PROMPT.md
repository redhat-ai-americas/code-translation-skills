I have a complete Python 2→3 migration skill suite at `/Users/wjackson/Developer/code-translation-skills/`. Please read these files to get up to speed:

1. `planning/PLAN.md` — the complete migration skill suite plan (26 skills across 6 phases)
2. `BUILD-TRACKER.md` — tracks what's been built (all 26 complete)

**All 26 skills are built across 5 tiers:**

- **Tier 1 (Foundation):** Skill X.1 (Migration State Tracker), Skill 0.1 (Codebase Analyzer), Skill 0.2 (Data Format Analyzer), Skill X.3 (Gate Checker)
- **Tier 2 (Enable Phase 1):** Skill 0.5 (Lint Baseline), Skill 1.1 (Future Imports Injector), Skill 1.2 (Test Scaffold Generator), Skill 2.1 (Conversion Unit Planner)
- **Tier 3 (Core Conversion):** Skill 2.2 (Automated Converter), Skill 3.1 (Bytes/String Boundary Fixer), Skill 3.2 (Library Replacement Advisor), Skill 3.3 (Dynamic Pattern Resolver)
- **Tier 4 (Quality Assurance):** Skill 4.1 (Behavioral Diff Generator), Skill 4.3 (Encoding Stress Tester), Skill 4.4 (Migration Completeness Checker), Skill 4.2 (Performance Benchmarker)
- **Tier 5 (Polish and Cutover):** Skill 0.3 (Serialization Boundary Detector), Skill 0.4 (C Extension Flagger), Skill 1.3 (CI Dual-Interpreter Configurator), Skill 1.4 (Custom Lint Rule Generator), Skill 2.3 (Build System Updater), Skill 3.4 (Type Annotation Adder), Skill 5.1 (Canary Deployment Planner), Skill 5.2 (Compatibility Shim Remover), Skill 5.3 (Dead Code Detector), Skill X.2 (Rollback Plan Generator)
- **All 12 reference documents** bundled into each skill's own `references/` directory

**Important context:**
- This codebase is a legacy system where the original developers are gone — it's an archaeology project
- Data sources include IoT/SCADA devices (Modbus, water monitors), CNC/machine automation, and mainframe systems
- The bytes/str boundary and encoding handling is the highest-risk area
- Each skill follows the skill-creator framework
- Every code-generating skill accepts a `target_version` parameter (3.9, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13)

**Potential next steps:**
1. **Integration testing** — run the full pipeline end-to-end on a real codebase to validate skill interactions
2. **Orchestration skill** — build a master orchestrator that chains all 26 skills in the correct order with gate checks
3. **Eval suite** — create test codebases (synthetic Py2 projects with known patterns) to validate each skill's detection accuracy
4. **Documentation** — generate a user guide / quickstart for running the migration pipeline
5. **Bug fixes** — iterate on individual skills based on real-world testing feedback

Please read planning/PLAN.md and BUILD-TRACKER.md, then tell me what you'd like to work on.
