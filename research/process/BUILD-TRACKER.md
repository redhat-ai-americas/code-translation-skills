## Build Notes
- Each skill follows the skill-creator framework: SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter, scripts/, references/, assets/
- See PLAN.md for full specifications of each skill
- Reference docs are bundled into each skill's own references/ directory
- Target version parameterization is required for all skills that generate or transform code
- **ALL 26 SKILLS COMPLETE** — all 5 Tiers built (26/26 skills, 12 reference docs bundled per-skill)
- All scripts pass Python 3 syntax validation (py_compile)
- Skill 3.1 also generated bytes-str-patterns.md (bundled in relevant skills' references/)
- Tier 4 built all 5 remaining shared references (encoding-test-vectors, encoding-edge-cases, adversarial-encoding-inputs, industrial-data-encodings, hypothesis-strategies)
- Skill 4.4 checks 10 categories of migration artifacts with severity-based gate blocking
- Skill 4.2 includes statistical analysis (CI, IQR outlier detection) and optimization opportunity scanning
- Tier 5 completed 10 remaining skills in a single session, all syntax-validated
