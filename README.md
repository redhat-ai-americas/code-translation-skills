# py2to3 Migration Skill Suite

**27 skills | 6 phases | 53 scripts**

A skill suite for [Claude](https://claude.ai) that guides large-scale Python 2 to Python 3 migrations. Built on the [skill-creator](https://github.com/anthropics/courses/tree/master/skill-creator) framework, each skill is a self-contained unit that an AI agent can load to perform a specific migration task — from initial codebase analysis through final cutover.

## Prerequisites

- **[Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code)** (or any Claude environment with skills support)
- **Python 3.6+** on the host machine (for running skill scripts — this is separate from the Python 2 codebase you're migrating)
- A **Python 2 codebase** to migrate

## Why this exists

Python 2 reached end of life in January 2020, but significant Py2 codebases remain in production — particularly in industries where software life cycles are measured in decades. Industrial control systems, financial platforms, scientific infrastructure, and government systems all contain Python 2 code that has run reliably enough that rewriting was never prioritized.

These migrations are harder than typical web application conversions. The codebases are larger, older, and less well-tested. The original developers may be gone. The data flows span binary protocols, legacy encodings, and serialization formats never designed for cross-version compatibility. This skill suite encodes the patterns and procedures needed to handle that complexity systematically.

## Architecture

The suite follows a six-phase pipeline with explicit gate criteria between phases. Three orchestration skills cut across all phases to track state, enforce gates, and generate rollback plans.

```
Phase 0        Phase 1          Phase 2          Phase 3        Phase 4           Phase 5
Discovery  --> Foundation  -->  Mechanical  -->  Semantic  -->  Verification  --> Cutover
(5 skills)     (4 skills)       (3 skills)       (4 skills)     (4 skills)        (3 skills)

                    Orchestration (3 skills: State Tracker, Gate Checker, Rollback)
```

Each phase transition requires meeting specific gate criteria — there is no skipping ahead. Every phase includes rollback procedures so work can be unwound safely if issues surface downstream.

All code-generating skills accept a `--target-version` parameter (3.9, 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13) and adjust their output for version-specific breaking changes like `distutils` removal in 3.12 and module deprecations across releases.

## Skills

### Phase 0 — Discovery

| Skill | Directory | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 0.1 Codebase Analyzer | `py2to3-codebase-analyzer` | Scans the codebase for Py2 constructs, builds dependency graphs, determines migration order |
| 0.2 Data Format Analyzer | `py2to3-data-format-analyzer` | Maps bytes/string boundaries, binary protocols, encoding hotspots across the data layer |
| 0.3 Serialization Detector | `py2to3-serialization-detector` | Finds pickle, marshal, shelve, and custom serialization that will break across versions |
| 0.4 C Extension Flagger | `py2to3-c-extension-flagger` | Identifies C extensions, SWIG bindings, ctypes usage, and Cython modules needing ABI updates |
| 0.5 Lint Baseline Generator | `py2to3-lint-baseline-generator` | Captures the current lint state so regressions can be detected during migration |

### Phase 1 — Foundation

| Skill | Directory | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 1.1 Future Imports Injector | `py2to3-future-imports-injector` | Adds `from __future__` imports to make Py2 code forward-compatible |
| 1.2 Test Scaffold Generator | `py2to3-test-scaffold-generator` | Generates characterization tests that capture current behavior before conversion |
| 1.3 CI Dual-Interpreter Config | `py2to3-ci-dual-interpreter` | Configures CI pipelines to run tests under both Py2 and Py3 simultaneously |
| 1.4 Custom Lint Rules | `py2to3-custom-lint-rules` | Generates project-specific lint rules that block Py2 regressions in converted code |

### Phase 2 — Mechanical Conversion

| Skill | Directory | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 2.1 Conversion Unit Planner | `py2to3-conversion-unit-planner` | Groups modules into atomic conversion units based on dependency coupling |
| 2.2 Automated Converter | `py2to3-automated-converter` | Applies mechanical syntax transforms (print, exceptions, imports, dict methods, etc.) |
| 2.3 Build System Updater | `py2to3-build-system-updater` | Updates setup.py, requirements, tox configs, and packaging for Py3 compatibility |

### Phase 3 — Semantic Fixes

| Skill | Directory | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 3.1 Bytes/String Fixer | `py2to3-bytes-string-fixer` | Resolves bytes/str boundary issues — the hardest part of any Py2→3 migration |
| 3.2 Library Replacement | `py2to3-library-replacement` | Advises on replacing removed stdlib modules and deprecated third-party libraries |
| 3.3 Dynamic Pattern Resolver | `py2to3-dynamic-pattern-resolver` | Handles metaclasses, `__slots__`, descriptor protocols, and dynamic attribute patterns |
| 3.4 Type Annotation Adder | `py2to3-type-annotation-adder` | Adds type annotations to public interfaces, with encoding-aware types for data boundaries |

### Phase 4 — Verification

| Skill | Directory | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 4.1 Behavioral Diff Generator | `py2to3-behavioral-diff-generator` | Produces side-by-side behavioral diffs between Py2 and Py3 execution |
| 4.2 Performance Benchmarker | `py2to3-performance-benchmarker` | Benchmarks Py3 performance against Py2 baseline with statistical analysis |
| 4.3 Encoding Stress Tester | `py2to3-encoding-stress-tester` | Throws adversarial encoding inputs (EBCDIC, mixed encodings, binary protocols) at converted code |
| 4.4 Completeness Checker | `py2to3-completeness-checker` | Audits the entire codebase to verify nothing was missed across 10 migration categories |

### Phase 5 — Cutover

| Skill | Directory | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 5.1 Canary Deployment Planner | `py2to3-canary-deployment-planner` | Plans staged rollout with traffic splitting, monitoring, and automatic rollback triggers |
| 5.2 Compatibility Shim Remover | `py2to3-compatibility-shim-remover` | Identifies and removes `six`, `future`, and `__future__` compatibility layers post-migration |
| 5.3 Dead Code Detector | `py2to3-dead-code-detector` | Finds Py2-only code paths, unused compatibility wrappers, and unreachable branches |

### Orchestration (cross-cutting)

| Skill | Directory | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| X.0 Project Initializer | `py2to3-project-initializer` | Bootstraps the migration project: directory structure, TODO.md, kickoff prompt, handoff prompt pattern |
| X.1 Migration State Tracker | `py2to3-migration-state-tracker` | Maintains per-module migration state, tracks phase progression, generates dashboards |
| X.2 Rollback Plan Generator | `py2to3-rollback-plan-generator` | Produces phase-specific rollback runbooks with git, K8s, and infrastructure commands |
| X.3 Gate Checker | `py2to3-gate-checker` | Enforces gate criteria for all 5 phase transitions, blocks progression until requirements are met |

## Getting Started

### Install

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/redhat-ai-americas/code-translation-skills.git
cd code-translation-skills

# Install all 27 skills to ~/.claude/skills/ (global)
./scripts/install-skills.sh

# Or install to a specific project (creates .claude/skills/ inside the project)
./scripts/install-skills.sh /path/to/your/python2-project

# Re-run anytime to update — existing skills are replaced cleanly
./scripts/install-skills.sh --force
```

The installer copies each skill into `.claude/skills/` where Claude discovers them automatically. You can also install specific skills with `--skill NAME`, preview with `--dry-run`, or list what's available with `--list`.

### Start a migration

After installing, see **[Getting Started](GETTING-STARTED.md)** for the full walkthrough. The short version:

1. Open a Claude Code session in your Python 2 project
2. Ask Claude to run the **py2to3-project-initializer** — it creates a `migration-analysis/` directory, a tracking TODO, and a kickoff prompt
3. Use the generated kickoff prompt to begin Phase 0 (Discovery)
4. At the end of each session, the agent writes a **handoff prompt** for the next session — this is how context passes between sessions without losing anything

### How skills work

Each skill follows the skill-creator framework's three-level progressive disclosure:

1. **Metadata** (YAML frontmatter in `SKILL.md`) — always visible to the agent for routing
2. **Instructions** (SKILL.md body) — loaded when the skill is triggered
3. **Resources** (`scripts/` and `references/`) — loaded as needed during execution

The agent reads the SKILL.md, understands the inputs and outputs, and runs the Python scripts in `scripts/` against your codebase. Each skill produces structured JSON output and a human-readable markdown report.

Reference documents (encoding patterns, syntax change catalogs, test vectors, etc.) are bundled in each skill's own `references/` directory — no external dependencies between skills.
